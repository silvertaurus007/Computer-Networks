1)			Exercise 1
->	arp : Using the arp command allows you to display and modify the Address
 Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. An ARP cache is a simple mapping of IP addresses 
 to MAC addresses.
-> ipconfig : The ipconfig command is a fast way of determining your computer's IP 
address and other information, such as the address of its default gatewayâ€”useful 
if you want to know the IP address of your router's web interface.
Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : am.amrita.edu 
Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::f9d7:4d5c:774:1c6c%13
->route : The route command allows you to make manual entries into the network
 routing tables. 
->Ping : The ping command is usually used as a simple way to verify that a computer 
can communicate over the network with another computer or network device.The ping 
command operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request 
messages to the destination computer and waiting for a response.
->tracert : Traceroute is a command which can show you the path a packet of 
information takes from your computer to one you specify. It will list all the
routers it passes through until it reaches its destination, or fails to and
is discarded.

a)What is loopback address? 

Loopback address is a special IP number (127.0.0.1) that is designated
for the software loopback interface of a machine. The loopback interface
has no hardware associated with it, and it is not physically connected to
a network.
b)Difference between IP address and default gateway
Ip address:An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical 
label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that 
uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
The gateway has two IP address. One is an external IP address assigned by 
your ISP (internet service provider), and the other an internal IP address 
that is only accessible within your network. This internal IP address is also
called you default gateway IP address.
